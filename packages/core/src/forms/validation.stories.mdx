# Form Validation

    This component or utility is offered as a preview. This means we are currently working on it and seeking feedback.

</cds-alert-group>

Clarity Core Forms do not provide a custom validation system. You can use Core Forms
with any validation library or framework of your choice. Clarity Core Forms can sync
with the [native HTML5 form validation system](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation)
built into the browser.

## HTML5 Validation

To auto sync with the native HTML5 form validation apply the `validate` attribute on the
`cds-form-group` or any `cds-` form control. Control messages can be synced to
the HTML5 form validaiton by setting the `error` attr with a [ValidityState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState)
value on a control message.

## Disable with `novalidate`

To disable HTML5 Validation add the [`novalidate` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#attr-novalidate) to the `form` element.
If you are using a framework level form management system such as [Angular Forms](https://angular.io/guide/forms-overview)
the `novalidate` is automatically handled for you.
