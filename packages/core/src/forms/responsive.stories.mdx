# Responsive Form Controls

All controls are responsive and will shift to a smaller layout if the parent
container is no longer wide enough for the current layout. Each control
determines its layout independenly.

<Preview>
  <Story id="forms-preview-forms-stories--responsive-checkbox-group" />
</Preview>

## Responsive Form Groups

When a set of controls are contained within a `cds-form-group` they will collapse
together when changing from vertical and horizontal layouts. Form labels will also
be automatically set to match the same width for proper alignment.

<Preview>
  <Story id="forms-preview-forms-stories--responsive" />
</Preview>

## Disabling Responsive Behavior

To disable the responsive behavior set the `responsive` attribute or property
to `false`. This will disable auto detection.

<Preview>
  <Story id="forms-preview-forms-stories--disabled-responsive-checkbox-group" />
</Preview>

## Complex Responsive Form layouts

The form control components can be used with the [`cds-layout` system](./?path=/story/foundation-layout-get-started--page)
to create complex multi column layouts. [Code Example](./?path=/docs/forms-preview-forms-stories--checkout-form#checkout-form)

<Story id="forms-preview-forms-stories--responsive-checkout-form" />
