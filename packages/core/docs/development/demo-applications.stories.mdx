# Clarity Core Demo Applications

In a typical development cycle, we use Storybook. Within the Clarity repository,
however, we provide several minimal demo apps to use to test with. The core demo
apps can be found here https://github.com/vmware/clarity/tree/master/apps.

The demo apps should remain simple single-page demo apps. This helps us quickly
determine that the component works within the given environment. Keeping the demos
simple also offers new users of Clarity a quick way to get started in their
framework of choice.

In general, all Core components should be compatible with the same expectations
defined by the tests on https://custom-elements-everywhere.com
