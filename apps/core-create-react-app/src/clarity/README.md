# Clarity Core React

A shim layer (a.k.a wrapper) must be used for web components to work in React
applications. This is due to React not being compatible with Web Standards such
as [custom elements](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com). You can find a
prototype demo in this example app. A packaged version will be released in the
near future.
