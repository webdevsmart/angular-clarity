## CSS

Card classes are used on native HTML elements.

### Classes

<DocComponentApi component="ClrCard" item="css" />

### Discuss / Opinion

We have demos of lists, list groups & progress and cards in grid/columns layouts

- list/list group examples should be with lists
- progress examples should move to progress
- cards in grid/column should move to app layout
